# Project Interstice
## Introduction
**Surveillance** is an integral part of security and control. The job requires extended periods of looking into multiple video footages for an undesirable incident or evidence following the incident, which proves to be highly inefficient considering the massive amount of footages. This manual task provides evidence in court but is rarely used to ***prevent crime or react to it in real-time***.

### üî≠ &nbsp; About this Project
In this project, we aim to develop a **real-time crime detection technology** that can be integrated with any security system, to ensure public safety through **visual crowd surveillance**.<br>
The system will detect and simultaneously alert any violent activity captured by the camera. The technologies encompasses domains of Computer Vision and Deep Learning models like **CNN, R-CNN, LSTM**. The dataset consists of 500+ videos scraped off internet and categorized into ***violent and non-violent*** activities.
